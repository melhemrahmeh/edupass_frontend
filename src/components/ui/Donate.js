                  EduPass is a venture built by students to support students
                  facing struggles in their educational journey. All our
                  services are free, and all team members are doing voluntary
                  work to run the venture. We receive support from volunteers
                  who believe in our mission. However, budget is needed to hire
                  well experienced teachers to provide high quality education in
                  addition to app maintenance and other expenses to keep the
                  venture running.
