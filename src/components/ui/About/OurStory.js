                    EduPass is a platform that embodies adaptive learning to
                    remove all obstacles refugees are facing due to language
                    barriers and gap in education years. We aim to deliver high
                    quality education free of charge to all refugee students in
                    Lebanon along with the students from the host community
                    through our mobile application.
